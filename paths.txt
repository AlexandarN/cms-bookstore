RELATIVE path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory.

 ./ -> current directory
../ -> parent directory

ABSOLUTE paths start with / and point to the root of your site. A URL is a prime example of an absolute path.

/   -> root of a site
__dirname -> global variable that holds absolute path to the containing script
